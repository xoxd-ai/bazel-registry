# Immutability gate: a published modules/<name>/<version>/ directory is frozen.
#
# Fail-closed rule: if this PR's diff (merge-base..HEAD) touches any file inside a
# version directory that already existed at the merge-base, reject it. Minting a
# NEW version directory is allowed. Editing modules/<name>/metadata.json (the
# version index) is allowed, since that is how a new version is registered.
#
# Rationale: Bazel treats a published module version as content-addressed and
# immutable. Editing a shipped version in place makes the registry serve two
# integrity variants of the same URL, which produces intermittent bazel-graph
# checksum failures for every downstream consumer. Never re-edit a shipped
# version; publish a new one.
#
# One allowance, and only one: a shipped source.json may be re-recorded to
# follow a GitHub owner rename listed in registry-owner-renames.json, because
# api.github.com tarball archives embed the owner in their top directory and a
# rename changes the bytes a shipped URL serves. scripts/owner-rename-record.mjs
# judges each such file against the base commit; anything it refuses is a
# violation like any other.
#
# Usage: check-immutable-versions.sh [base-ref]
#   base-ref defaults to $GITHUB_BASE_REF, then "main".
